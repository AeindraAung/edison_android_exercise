# Fact app
This app shows a fact via [fact free api](https://catfact.ninja/fact).

## Issues
It works, but does not satisfy some requirements.

Please implement TODOs! (If you have time, please also try to do Optional.)

### TODO
- Show the `length` from the api response
- Access data via `Data layer`
- Add local data source (`DataStore`)
  - To show the previous fact for the next visit
- Add dependency injection by `Hilt`
- Add proper testing after introducing `Data layer` and `Hilt`
- Make the UI state immutable as much as possible

#### Note
**You can skip issues** if you 
- don't understand the meaning
- need to take a long time to learn new things for you

### Optional
If we have time, we want to
- (Design) Add the `Top app bar` and update the design 🏰
- (Testing) Add [JUnit5](https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5) and `fake` or `mockk`
- (Gradle) Add a `version catalog` 📗
- (Future growth) `Modularize` the app ✌🏻
- (Future growth) Add `Domain layer` 🚴‍️

## Time
We don't set the time limitation, so you can take your time. Please take it easy ✌🏻

But at the same time, we don't want you to take too long time on this. (don't want to consume your valuable time.)

So let's say,
- 1~2 hours on `Must` issues
- Another 1~2 hours on `Optional`

Optional requirements are optional, literally.  Please do them only if you can spend your valuable time on this.
